Errors

#1 

In the Auth0 dashboard, I cannot specify a login URL, because Auth0 requires an https URL.

#2 Routing is messed up

We have the routing errors detailed under point 1.1 and 1.2. 

The reason for these errors might be that 

- on one hand Auth0 uses the authorization grant flow which puts the code and the access token into the hash fragment of the URL

- on the other hand the routing of the UI template is based on HashRouter, which also uses the URL hash fragment, and 

- as a consequence, the two mechanisms are incompatible with each other.

A possible solution could be to rewrite the UI template from using hashed URLs to non-hashed URLs.

This might need some server-side coding.

The routing errors in detail:

2.1 Reloading the login pages has the same effect as pressing the Login button.

2.2 Improper URLs after login:

- After login the URL is http://localhost:3000/#/app/report, 

- but during token exchange it changes to http://localhost:3000. 

- After refreshing the page it changes to http://localhost:3000/#/app/report

#3

I cannot sign out from the app properly, just by deleting my cookies.

The signOut function in the Daml UI template only deletes the party id and token from the local storage.

A proper Auth0 sign-out should be implemented via the logout function provided by the Auth0 React SDK.
